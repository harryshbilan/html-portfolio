<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I am Harrysh S. Bilan, a aspiring web developer from the Philippines. I am currently studying at the
  New Era University. I am a self-taught web developer and I am very passionate about web development. I am currently
  studying HTML basics as for starters.</p>

<p>My hobbies are playing games in my free time and working out for 2-3hrs in gym. I spend my time mostly studying new things
  about web development and I am very excited to learn more about it. I am also a fan of anime and I love watching them in my free time.</p>
